# MS SQL

Databases are the standard way of using dynamic information in modern technology, making them an integral part of almost any application. This course introduces us to one of the most widely used Database Management Systems **`DBMS`**, used in the development of modern information systems - **`Microsoft SQL Server`**.

**`Database Basics with MS SQL Server`** course pays serious attention to the relational model, modeling of data with ER diagrams (tables and relational links), and the use of **`SQL`** language (Data Extraction, Selection, Projection, Connections, Aggregation, Grouping, Modification, Deletion and Insertion).
It gives basic knowledge of working with **`ACID`** transactions and transactional processing, as well as practical performance tuning tips. It lays the foundation for working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications and understanding concepts like turning a database into an Object-Oriented Model **`ORM`**.
